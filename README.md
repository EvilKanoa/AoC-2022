### To run the benchmark:

1. You'll need Volta, or Node 16 and yarn installed.
2. Run `yarn` to get ts-node.
3. Run `yarn benchmark` to execute all solutions sequentially.

### To run an individual solution:

1. You'll still need Volta, or Node 16 and yarn installed.
3. Run `yarn` to get ts-node if you haven't.
3. Run `yarn start <name of solution file>`, for example: `yarn start day8.1.js` or `yarn start day9.2.ts`.
